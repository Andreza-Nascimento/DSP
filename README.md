# Digital Signal Processing

> This repository is a comprehensive archive of assignments undertaken for the *Digital Signal Processing* course (TIP7200) at the Federal University of Ceará as part of my Master's curriculum.

## Introduction 📖

Signal processing is essential in understanding and manipulating the information contained within signals. It encompasses the representation, transformation, and manipulation of these signals. Discrete-time signal processing focuses on the analysis of numeric sequences indexed by integers, a cornerstone of Digital Signal Processing (DSP). In DSP, signals are digitally represented by sequences of finite-precision numbers, allowing for processing via digital computation. The advent of faster computing has made real-time discrete-time processing of continuous-time signals a reality across various fields. Today, DSP is integral to advancements in communication systems, radar and sonar technologies, speech and video processing, biomedical engineering, and countless other application areas, highlighting its critical role in modern technology and innovation.
